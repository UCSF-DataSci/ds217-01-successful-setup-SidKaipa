# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
I studied bioinformatics at UCSD. Once I graduated, I took a gap year during which I worked at 2 labs. I focused on proteomics at a lab in Stanford, and the paper I worked on is about to be published.

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
I hope to be able to code properly and be comfortable using code to study data science. I would like to work in the bay after graduation, ideally in genomics. I have background in coding, specifically in Java and Python, but I'm still not comfortable coding per se.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I am quite nervous about the amount of coding or how in depth the coding aspect of data science will be, as coding isn't my strong suit nor passion. However, I do understand that coding is an integral part of data science so I will need to get comfortable with it.

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]

I am really into movies! I have worked my way through all the classics and various decades, and am now working my way through the IMDB top 250 list. I have seen over 1000 movies, and can easily talk anyone's ears off about the magic of movies.
